# Movie-Recommendation
The Movie Recommendation System is a data-driven project designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences, leveraging a dataset with extensive user and movie information. The system employs advanced techniques from data mining, machine learning, and collaborative filtering to improve recommendation accuracy.
The Full Dataset: Consists of 26,000,000 ratings and 750,000 tag applications applied to 45,000 movies by 270,000 users. Includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags.

# Methods Used in the Movie Recommendation System
## 1. Content-Based Filtering
Overview: This approach recommends movies by analyzing their attributes (e.g., genre, director, cast) and matching them with a userâ€™s profile or past preferences.
Process:
Builds a profile of the user based on their interactions with movies (e.g., liked genres or directors).
Calculates the similarity between a user's preferred movies and other movies in the dataset using similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity or Jaccard index).
Recommends movies that are most similar to the user's past preferences.

## 2. User-Based Collaborative Filtering
Overview: Recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.
Process:
Finds users with similar movie preferences using a similarity metric (e.g., Pearson correlation or cosine similarity).
Aggregates ratings from these similar users to predict the target user's preferences.

## 3. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
Overview: Focuses on the similarity between items (movies) rather than users.
Process:
Computes the similarity between movies based on user ratings (e.g., movies rated highly by similar users are considered related).
Suggests movies similar to those the user has already enjoyed.

## 4. Hybrid Filtering
Overview: Combines multiple recommendation methods (content-based, user-based, and item-based) to mitigate individual limitations and improve accuracy.
Process:
Merges recommendations from content-based and collaborative filtering models.
Uses a weighted or switching approach to balance the strengths of each method.
For example:
Weighted Hybrid: Combines scores from different models based on predefined weights.
Switching Hybrid: Switches between methods based on specific conditions (e.g., use content-based for new users and collaborative for experienced ones).
